In this directory is stocked all kinds of data representation that we want to build a coherent world. Having a lot of different primitives allows for more efficient way of doing things. On the other hand, it complexify the project because each primitive need to be drawn, which depend a lot of what grapphical lib we chose. Also, to build a collision system we need to implement eeach primtive to other primitive interaction.
